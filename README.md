1 - Configuration:

- It is necessary to install mongodb and create a collection for users with unique username:
you type this command "db.UserCollection.createIndex( { "username": 1 }, { unique: true } )"

- It's necessary to insert the first admin by mongo's shell:
for example you could type this command --> db.UserCollection.insert({"name":"YOUR_NAME","surname":"YOUR_SURNAME","username":"YOUR_USERNAME","password":"YOUR_PASSWORD","role":"ADMIN"})

- If you wanted to remove "Uniparthenope" logo you would set flag = false in view.py in function index
